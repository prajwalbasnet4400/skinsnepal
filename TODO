    - Buyer `BUYS` the skin using esewa payment gateway // Money is delivered to server wallet
    - The Listing is now hidden from the market until the transaction completes
    - Server is notified of payment and notifies the `SELLER` to send the trade offer // Seller sends a screenshot for verification
    - Server after receiveing the screenshot notifies the `BUYER` to accept the trade offer// Buyer sends a screenshot for verification
    - Then the money is transferred to the `SELLER` after deducting a % as a transaction fee.
    - The `Listing`, `Seller`, `Buyer` and `Payement receipt` are stored in the database permanently
